        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Chicken katsu is Japanese-style fried chicken. 
           This is my family recipe and can also be used to make tonkatsu by using pork cutlets instead of chicken. Serve with white rice and tonkatsu sauce.</p>
        <div class="recipe-container">
            <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Chicken</strong>: You'll need four skinless, boneless chicken breast halves.</li>
                <li><strong>Seasonings</strong>: This chicken katsu recipe is simply seasoned with salt and pepper.</li>
                <li><strong>Flour</strong>: All-purpose flour helps seal in the moisture, adds flavor, and promotes browning.</li>
                <li><strong>Egg</strong>: An egg adds moisture and gives the Panko something to stick to.</li>
                <li><strong>Panko</strong>: Panko bread crumbs are responsible for katsu's signature crunch.</li>
                <li><strong>Oil</strong>: Opt for a neutral oil with a high smoke point, such as canola or vegetable oil.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
